# TODO
# Create a decorator from the njit decorator that allows mesmerize to see whether it needs to use parallization on a given method, based on the available resources.
# Allowing developers to ONLY change the decorators to apply a system-wide effect!

# Alternatively, make a new base-object class in mesmerize from which ALL classes inherit, allowing system-wide changes equally
